# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  #push:
  #  branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:

  aws:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
