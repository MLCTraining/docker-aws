This project will show you how to deploy a Docker cluster in AWS.

You will be able to deploy two different orchestrators of your choice: Swarm and Kubernetes.

The cluster will be highly available (HA) with 3 masters and 3 workers evenly distributed in 3 different availability zones located in the same AWS region.

You may choose deploying manually or with the help of a fully automated script:
* [Automated installation in AWS](README-auto.md)
* [Manual installation in AWS](README-manual.md)
